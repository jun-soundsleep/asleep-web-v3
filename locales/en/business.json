  "home_psg_device_content": "Polysomnography in hospitals tend to be very costly as it takes up a considerable amount of professional medical experts' time and effort, as well as physical space to conduct the test in. Due to these restrictions, hospitals are having trouble meeting the rapidly increasing demand for PSGs and the rising numbers of sleep disorder cases. Hospitals are so short on meeting these demands that patients have to wait several months just to receive PSG. One other factor that makes effective sleep disorder treatment difficult is the fact that doctors solely reply on the patient's subjective sleep assessment after the first PSG test to determine the patient's sleep condition.\n\nAsleep is in the process of creating a sleep device that can measure/track sleep both conveniently and accurately at home. Through this device, it is possible to monitor the patient's sleep at home at all times. In addition, we expect that sleep home screening enabled through this device will alleviate the problem hospitals face by allowing patients to determine whether they need to take PSG tests."
